# choox

A Symfony project created on April 1, 2016, 6:53 pm.

## Trello board
This project uses Trello to keep track of what still needs to be done
or bugs found via the user interface. It is partly in German but the important stuff will
all be in English.

We welcome you to visit our [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/COpW5BwY)!

### Translations
run `bin/console translation:extract en de --config=app` in the choox directory
and visit /app_dev.php/_trans/ to view, update and add translations.
